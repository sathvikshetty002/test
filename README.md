# Automated Feature Engineering with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In this project, I explore how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to automatically generate meaningful features from raw data. Instead of manually designing features, the model learns representations directly from the input data, even when the data is noisy or unstructured.

The generated features can then be leveraged in downstream supervised learning tasks, particularly in areas like computer vision, where effective feature extraction plays a critical role in model performance.

The goal of this project is to investigate how GAN-based feature learning can improve model robustness and accuracy while reducing the need for manual feature engineering.

### Python Setup

To set up the required Python environment, install the dependencies using:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
